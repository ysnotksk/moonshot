        strong San Francisco, CA &mdash; February 15, 2026 &mdash;
        |  Moonshot, the monochrome-first CSS framework for startups, today announced the
        | close of a $25 million Series B funding round led by Horizon Ventures, with
        | participation from existing investors Basecamp Capital and Lighthouse Partners.

      .ms-paragraph
        | The new capital will be used to expand the Moonshot team from 30 to 80 employees
        | over the next 18 months, with a focus on engineering, developer relations, and
        | enterprise sales. The company plans to open offices in London and Singapore to
        | complement its existing San Francisco and Tokyo locations.

      .ms-paragraph
        | "This funding validates our belief that the future of web development lies in
        | opinionated, accessible-by-default frameworks that prioritize speed to market,"
        | said Jane Smith, CEO and co-founder of Moonshot. "Our enterprise customers have
        | seen a 40% reduction in time-to-launch for corporate websites."

      .ms-paragraph
        | Since the launch of Moonshot CSS v2.0 in January, the framework has been adopted
        | by over 500 companies worldwide. Key enterprise features include brand
        | customization tokens, WCAG 2.2 AA compliance out of the box, and a comprehensive
        | template library covering 17 page types.

      .ms-paragraph
        | The company also announced plans to launch Moonshot Pro, a premium tier offering
        | advanced analytics dashboards, A/B testing integration, and priority support for
        | enterprise teams. Moonshot Pro is expected to be available in Q3 2026.
